# CS.261.Data.Structures
This repo contains all of my classwork from my term taking Data Structures. 

Assignments:

A1 -- An icebreaker for the course with a variety of LEETCODE style problems like reverse, rotate, countsort, etc..

A2 -- An implementation of a Dynamic Array using a Static Array as the underlying data structure. Also, a brief implementation of the Bag structure with my first ever iterator function built in.

A3 -- Linked Lists, Stacks, & Queues using Dynamic Arrays in the undercarriage. Of note, the circular buffer feature in the Queue.

A4 -- BSTs & AVLs, widely regarded as one of the hardest assignments in our program! AVLs allow us to do a number of operations at an impressively fast O(log n) time complexity, however balancing and rotating an AVL tree is difficult to implement.

A5 -- Minimum Heaps. This data structure can be thought of as tree at face value, truly though, it uses a Queue in the undercarriage to facilitate its operations. This module contains a sub quadratic sorting function called HeapSort.

A6 -- Hash Maps! This was my favorite assignment. We implemented two type of collision resolution. One was Separate Chaining, the other was Open Addressing. Both have pros and cons. SC uses a linked list in each index of the Hash Map's dynamic array while OA uses a quadratic probing method to ensure each data entry goes to an empty spot.
